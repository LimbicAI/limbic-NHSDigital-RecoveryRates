 In this repository you will find the data and analysis script for the research article  "Conversational AI facilitates mental health assessments and is associated with improved recovery rates". 

 The scripts for all analyses and figures in this paper can be found in Analysis.ipynb. 

 The relevant data can be found in the folder /data whereby the data was derived from the monthly reports on the NHS digital IAPT database (https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/psychological-therapies-report-on-the-use-of-iapt-services), so that this data could also be derived directly from this source.
